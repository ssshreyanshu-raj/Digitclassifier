# Handwritten Digit Classifier

Built this project to identify handwritten numbers - basically taught my computer to read digits like a human would! 

## What it does
Takes any handwritten number (0-9) and recognizes it automatically.I used the MNIST dataset to train it .

## Getting Started
You'll need:
- Python (any recent version works)
- Some basic libraries (TensorFlow, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- A bit of patience while it trains ðŸ˜…

## Quick Start
1. Grab the code
2. Install the stuff mentioned above
3. Fire up the notebook
4. Watch it recognize numbers!
